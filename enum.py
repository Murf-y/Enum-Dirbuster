"""
Create a Python script that can be run on a website to
discover subdomains (e.g. admin-test.domain.com), directories (e.g.
domain.com/for_admins_only/), and files (e.g. domain.com/user_passwords.txt). This
script will reveal hidden links that may lead to pages with vulnerabilities. Additionally,
two text files are provided, which you will use to read potential subdomains and
directories rather than generating them from scratch.
Your script should be executed from the terminal with the command "python
test_script.py" and should take an argument that represents the target website's URL.
The script must store the input file values and write the output to the following files:
● subdomains_output.bat
● directories_output.bat
● files_output.bat
